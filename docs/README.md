## 0. Prerequisites

Complete these items before beginning.

### Accounts

You will need:

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
- An [Expo account](https://expo.dev/signup) for saving and sharing an Expo Snack

Make sure you can sign in to both accounts.

### Software

You will need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), the Node Version Manager (easy way to get to the needed version, currently the minimum is  20.19.4 )
  - Windows users may use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
- A code editor:
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
  - Students can apply for a free [JetBrains educational license](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) on your iOS or Android device

Check your setup by opening a terminal and running:

```bash
git --version
nvm --version
node --version
npm --version
```

Each command should print a version number.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You probably already have Node.js installed. Do not reinstall Node.js just because you encounter an error. Reinstalling it may create conflicts with your existing setup.
>
> Use `nvm` to manage Node versions. If you are uncertain, ask an AI assistant or your instructor before changing your Node installation.

### GitHub authentication

GitHub may ask you to authenticate when you clone or push.

See [GitHub's authentication documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github) for setup instructions. An AI assistant can also guide you through the steps for your operating system.

Never share your password, personal access token, or SSH private key with anyone—including an AI assistant.

## 1. Fork the Class Repository

A **fork** is your own copy of the class repository on GitHub.

1. Open the class repository in GitHub.
2. Select **Fork** in the upper-right corner.
3. Keep the suggested repository name unless your assignment says otherwise.
4. Select **Create fork**.

After GitHub finishes, confirm that the repository appears under your GitHub username.

Your fork's URL should look like this:

```text
https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME
```

---

## 2. Clone Your Fork

A **clone** is a copy of the repository on your computer.

On your fork's GitHub page:

1. Select the green **Code** button.
2. Select **HTTPS**.
3. Copy the repository URL.
4. Open a terminal.
5. Move to the folder where you keep class projects.
6. Run the following commands, replacing the placeholders with your information:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
cd REPOSITORY-NAME
```

Confirm that you cloned your own fork:

```bash
git remote -v
```

The `origin` URLs should contain your GitHub username.

> Here is the complete error:
> ERROR-MESSAGE
> ```

---

## 3. Create the Expo App

This starter repository intentionally does not contain a `package.json` or an Expo application. You will generate the application files yourself.

Make sure your terminal is inside the cloned repository:

```bash
pwd
```

On Windows PowerShell, you can also use:

```powershell
Get-Location
```

Then create a blank Expo application inside the current repository:

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest . --template blank
```

The `.` means “create the Expo app in the current folder.”

If you are asked whether packages may be installed, enter `y`.

If it asks what SDK version you want to install, choose `"For learning with Expo Go (SDK 54)"` if available, 
otherwise the most recent.

It should ask you ` You are creating a project inside of an existing Git repository. Skip initializing a new git repository?` - say `Y` for yes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run this command only once. Do not run it again after you have started building your prototype unless your instructor specifically tells you to do so.

When the command finishes, confirm that the repository now contains files such as:

```text
package.json
App.js
```

The exact files may vary depending on the current Expo template.

> [!TIP]

> Complete error:
> ERROR-MESSAGE
>
> Explain the likely cause in beginner-friendly language and give me
> one troubleshooting step at a time. Do not tell me to reinstall Node
> unless you first explain why that is necessary.
> ```

---

## 4. Create a Work Branch

Your assignment may require a specific branch name. Check the assignment instructions before continuing.

Create and switch to a new branch:

```bash
git switch -c BRANCH-NAME
```

For example, if your assigned branch name is `prototype-one`, you would run:

```bash
git switch -c prototype-one
```

Confirm your current branch:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

The result should match your branch name.

---

## 5. Run the App Locally

Start the Expo development server:

```bash
npx expo start
```

A QR code and development menu should appear.

### Run on a physical device

1. Connect your computer and phone to the same network when possible.
2. Open **Expo Go** on your phone.
3. Scan the QR code shown by Expo.

On iOS, you may need to scan the QR code with the Camera app.

### Run in a simulator or emulator

From the Expo terminal:

- Press `a` to open an Android emulator.
- Press `i` to open an iOS Simulator.

The iOS Simulator requires macOS and Xcode. The Android emulator requires Android Studio and an emulator configured in advance.

### If your phone cannot connect

Stop the Expo server by pressing `Ctrl+C`, and then try tunnel mode:

```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```

## 6. Build Your Prototype

Edit the starter application according to the assignment instructions.

Your main component will usually be:

```text
App.js
```

Depending on your Expo template and course instructions, the project may use different files.

Keep the Expo terminal running while you work. Expo should automatically update the preview after you save a file.

Check your Git changes periodically:

```bash
git status
```

---

## 7. Save Your Work with Git

When you reach a useful checkpoint, save your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "YOUR-MESSAGE"
```

Replace `YOUR-MESSAGE` with a short description of what you changed.

For example:

```bash
git commit -m "Add prototype home screen"
```

Push your branch to your GitHub fork:

```bash
git push -u origin BRANCH-NAME
```

Replace `BRANCH-NAME` with the branch name you created earlier.

After the first push, you can upload later commits with:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "YOUR-MESSAGE"
git push
```

Good commit messages briefly describe what changed:

```text
Add prototype navigation
Create profile screen layout
Fix button spacing
Update colors and typography
```

## 8. Publish an Expo Snack

[Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/) creates a browser-based version of your app that can be shared with a URL.

Make sure you have pushed your latest work to GitHub before creating the Snack.

### Option A: Import from GitHub

1. Open [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/).
2. Sign in to your Expo account.
3. Use Snack's GitHub import option.
4. Enter or select your public GitHub repository.
5. Confirm that Snack imported the correct files and branch.
6. Test the app in Snack.
7. Select **Save**.
8. Copy the saved Snack URL.

A saved Snack URL should look similar to:

```text
https://snack.expo.dev/@YOUR-EXPO-USERNAME/SNACK-NAME
```

### Option B: Copy the Project Manually

If GitHub import does not work:

1. Open [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/).
2. Sign in to your Expo account.
3. Copy your main component into the Snack editor.
4. Create any additional files used by your component.
5. Add external packages through Snack's dependency controls.
6. Test the preview.
7. Select **Save**.
8. Copy the saved Snack URL.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some native libraries, local assets, configuration files, and platform-specific features may work locally but not in Snack. Your instructor may accept a simplified Snack preview if the full project uses unsupported features.

> [!TIP]
> **AI prompt idea**
>
> ```text
> My Expo app works locally but fails in Expo Snack.
>
> Packages used:
> PACKAGE-LIST
>
> Snack error:
> ERROR-MESSAGE
>
> Explain whether a dependency, local asset, file path, or native
> feature may be unsupported. Suggest the smallest change needed
> to create a working Snack preview.
> ```

## 9. Open a Pull Request

A **pull request**, or PR, asks the instructor to review your work.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your assignment may require a specific pull-request name. Check the assignment instructions before naming or submitting your pull request.

1. Make sure your latest changes have been committed and pushed.
2. Open your fork on GitHub.
3. Switch to `BRANCH-NAME` if necessary.
4. Select **Contribute** and then **Open pull request**.
5. Check the repository and branch information carefully.

The pull request should usually show:

```text
base repository: ORIGINAL-CLASS-REPOSITORY
base branch: main

head repository: YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/YOUR-FORK
compare branch: BRANCH-NAME
```

6. Enter the pull-request name required by the assignment. If no name is specified, use a short, descriptive name.
7. Complete the pull-request description.
8. Select **Create pull request**.

### Pull-request description

Copy and complete this template:

```markdown
## Prototype summary
